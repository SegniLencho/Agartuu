        In ancient manuscripts, another means to divide sentences into
                paragraphs was a line break (newline) followed by an initial
                at the beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an oversized
                capital letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of the text.
                This style can be seen, for example, in the original Old English
                manuscript of Beowulf. Outdenting is still used in English typography,
                though not commonly.[3] Modern English typography usually indicates
                a new paragraph by indenting the first line. This style can be seen
                in the (handwritten) United States Constitution from 1787.
